Things I found challenging (and have now improved on!):
- Getting images not to stretch
- Getting images in various levels of containers to ACTUALLY FLEX
- Deciding how to do left-right padding so it didn't look rubbish on different window sizes (probably haven't mastered that but I'm happy with it!)
- Avoiding duplication e.g. trying to have the fewest classes and divs
- Knowing if I should keep the TOP copyright for the layout - have erred on the safe side and kept it!
- Committing as often as I should have. Definitely scrapped some early versions because I couldn't see where I went wrong and didn't have a good commit to fall back on. On the plus side - lots of div practice!
- Good commit messages

Things I did well this time round (must have sunk in now!):
- colours (colors :P)
- tags
- boilerplate
- text-align!
